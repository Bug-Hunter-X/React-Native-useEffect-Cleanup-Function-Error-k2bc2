This repository demonstrates a common yet tricky error in React Native: an error thrown by a cleanup function in the `useEffect` hook after the component has unmounted. The `useEffectCleanupError.js` file shows the problematic code, and `useEffectCleanupSolution.js` presents a solution to resolve this issue.  The error occurs because the cleanup function attempts to interact with component state or other resources that no longer exist once the component is unmounted. This typically happens when asynchronous operations within the cleanup function take longer than the component's unmounting process.  The solution involves checking if the component is still mounted before executing any actions in the cleanup function. This prevents errors from occurring after unmounting.
